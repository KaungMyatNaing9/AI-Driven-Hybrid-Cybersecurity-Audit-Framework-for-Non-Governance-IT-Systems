# AI-Driven-Hybrid-Cybersecurity-Audit-Framework-for-Non-Governance-IT-Systems

---

## One-line summary
Proof-of-concept prototype that applies a **hybrid auditing logic** to cybersecurity for private (non-governance) IT systems.

---

## Project status
**Phase:** Design & prototype (literature survey + small proof-of-concept).

**Deliverables:** Prototypes, compliance mapping, bibliography, evaluation results, final report, and presentation.

---

## Motivation
Small and medium private organizations rarely have the resources for deep cybersecurity audits. A hybrid system can help with low-risk handling and make auditing more scalable. This allows human auditors focus on more high-impact issues.

---

## Research objectives
* **RO1 - Feasibility:** Building a small prototype demonstrating AI-based traffic analysis.
*  **RO2 — Compliance mapping:** Map detected issues to a set of compliance controls.
*  **RO3 — Evaluation:** Measure effectiveness of the prototype.
*  **RO4 — Recommendations:** Identify limitations, ethical issues, and next steps.

## Prototype overview
**High-level flow**
1. Ingest logs → preprocess → extract data
2. Anomaly detection
3. Risk scoring
4. Map findings → compliance controls
5. Output audit report
